Substrate is made from CuZr glass, and NOT Si

Problem statement:
CuZr clusters are being bombared onto the substrate

Clusters are supposed to have been accelerated with electric fields
which result in energy gains ranging from 50 eV-500 eV

Clusters are singly charged

I am going to assume clusters had 0 or negligible kinetic energy before impact

(1/2)*m*(v^2) = E
=> v = sqrt(2E/m)

E : eV
m : grams/mol

=> v = sqrt(2E*(1.6e-19)/((m/1000)*(6.022e23)))
